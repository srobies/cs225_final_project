## **CS 225 Data Structures**
**Team Contract (racheld3-slr6-mweiler3-provine2)**

**Communication**

1. **Team Meetings** 
   Our team will meet once a week using Zoom. The meetings will be held on Tuesdays at 6-7pm. All meetings should include all team members. Any necessary notes about what was discussed in the meeting will be noted on a Google Document that will be shared with the entire team. During each meeting, in addition to designating one team member as the leader of the meeting, we will designate one team member as the note-taker for the meeting. That team member will be responsible for drafting notes from the meeting on the shared document. The document will consist of various sections, with one for each meeting held.
2. **Assistance** 
   Each team member can be contacted through GroupMe, text messaging, or email. Aside from any emergencies, we commit to responding to all forms of communication within 24 hours.
3. **Respect** 
   Generally, the meeting lead role will rotate for each meeting. At the beginning of a meeting, members will vote on a team lead for the meeting. The team lead for each week will be noted in the meeting notes. All members will be able to state their opinions and thoughts on issues, design implementation, or other related topics. Decisions will be decided by a simple majority vote. All members agree to adhere to the decisions made during the meeting. 

**Collaboration**

1. **Work Distribution** 
   In our weekly meetings, we will determine which aspects of the assignment should be completed by the next week. Once we determine what should be done by the next meeting, we will decide which team member will complete each task first by allowing members to volunteer for tasks and second by assigning remaining tasks to members in a way that ensures all members are doing a relatively equal and fair amount of work. For example, if a member already volunteered for multiple assignments, that member will not be assigned any of the remaining tasks in order to split the work equally.
2. **Time Commitment** 
   To ensure an equal distribution of work, we will expect each member to be available for 1 to 3 hours each Tuesday night for team meetings. We will also expect each member to independently work for at least 1, but no more than 3 hours per week on the project. If a team member finds that a given deliverable or assignment takes much longer than expected, then we agree that the rest of the team will assist in completing that task to ensure that no member must spend an excessive amount of time on the project in a week, especially not if it would take significantly longer than the time spent by all other members.
3. **Conflict Resolution** 
   In the case of any disagreements, we will make a decision on the issue using a simple majority vote. If a team member’s schedule changes, we will discuss as a group to find a new time to meet that works with everyone’s schedules in order to avoid the issue of meeting without all members of the team. Unless there are special circumstances, we will expect all members to adhere to the day and time we agreed on, which was mentioned previously. If we run into any recurring issues, we will consult the mentor for our project and course staff for assistance.
